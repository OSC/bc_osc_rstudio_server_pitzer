      - **any** - (*1-40 cores*) Use any available Pitzer node. This reduces the
        wait time as there are no node requirements.
      - **hugemem** - (*80 cores*) Use an Pitzer node that has 3TB of
        available RAM as well as 40 cores. There are 4 of these nodes on
        Pitzer. Requesting hugemem nodes allocates entire nodes.
      - **debug** - (*1-40 cores*) For short sessions (= 1 hour) the debug
        queue will have the shortest wait time. This is only accessible during
        8AM - 6PM, Monday - Friday. There are 6 of these nodes on Pitzer.
      - **gpu** - (*1-40 cores*) This node includes two [NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs]
        and loads the [CUDA] 10.1.168 module. This node has 384GB of memory.
        There are currently only 32 of these nodes on Pitzer and it's only
        available for R version 3.6.3 and above.
